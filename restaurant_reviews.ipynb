But I loved how the beef was cooked with the bell peppers! I would get it again and the service was very kind! The ice cream deep fried was super good!\n",

The drinks were very good & tasty! Overall bill was decent for what we ordered! They also do have a lot of tvs on throughout the restaurant so if your into sports more than likely your game will be showing! Which is a plus for me. If ever in this area again I'd stop for some more.\n",

            "Review: Went into Tequilas to grab some takeout tonight. I have been waiting to try it for quite some time now. When I arrived it was very busy. Typical Mexican restaurant decor and vibe when you walk in. When you first look at the menu, you may be intimidated by the sheer size of it. They have a ton of things to choose from. I decided on just trying a couple of classic dishes. The fajitas Cancun and some Enchiladas. The fajitas Cancun are a mixture of steak, shrimp, and chicken, sautéed with peppers, onions, mushrooms, and pineapple served I side of a pineapple. The mixture is seasoned pretty well. Packed with flavor. They do one of the things I hate most... serving shrimp with the tail on. I don't get that. It's so annoying. They also did not give me any tortillas for the fajitas, so that was also a little unfortunate. The beans are a little bland and under seasoned pinto beans. There is nothing to remember either good or bad. Surprisingly, the rice was EXTREMELY flavorful! It was very good. Some of the best I've had!! The Enchiladas honestly taste about as good as they looked... meh.. everything was bland and lacked flavor. The ground beef filling was greasy and bland, and the sauce was boring and bland. It comes with refried beans and rice. The rice!! *chefs kiss**  Overall, the food was ok.. the fajitas warrant another chance, so I might be back if I'm feeling a little risky!\n",

We were asked to wait for about 15 minutes and were buzzed in around five.  Best sit down Mexican restaurant we’ve been to since moving to the area.\n",

            "Review: My youngest son recommended this Mexican restaurant. So my oldest son and my daughter wanted to try something new so we chose this place! I had the Menudo which was delicious, my daughter had a breakfast burrito that she said was okay but it was a little too salty for her tastes and my oldest son had the posole and he didn't like the fact that the meat had bones in it but he said it did taste good. Otherwise then that people were super nice the service was excellent! The sat sat us in a booth next to the handicap door which several seniors needed to use and it was just a little cold back there. I think next time I would rather not sit in that booth next to that door.\n",

            "Review: You will keep coming back... I happened upon El Mirador about 6 months ago and since lost count of my visits. The huevos divorciados breakfast is a spicy delight, and the carne asada burrito is a grand meal including guacamole & sour cream, side of rice & beans and plenty of asada meat. Don't forget to indulge in the an occasional molcojete bowl, El Mirador or Costeño seafood style will leave you feeling pampered. I always pair with a tall glass of jamaica (sweet & sour hibiscus tea) to tone down the heat. Even the chips and salsa are homemade with an extra kick of flavor you will not soon forget. They do get busy at times, but I've always managed to find parking. Sadly, gift cards are not available to share, so you'll need to bring any friends with you that you wish to experience this goodness.\n",

Place was busy and parking lot was pretty full (good signs for a restaurant). Seated without to much wait, and the server came to see us shortly after. Friendly service sand attentive throughout meal. We ordered standard Mexican fare, and was pleasantly surprised by the generous portions. Lots of seats and tables inside, with covered patio area outside. Parking lot is much bigger behind the restaurant. Recommended!\n",

            "Review: Have been coming to this restaurant for years and just now getting around to finally writing a review! This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. They offer a lot of authentic dishes but also cater to the Tex Mex side of the house in my opinion. The combination for two has been a favorite of mine for years. It’s plenty of food for two people and it is a great mix of foods to try and enjoy. My husband is a huge fan of the super burrito, except he’s a little picky and likes it without guacamole or tomatoes. Every time we dine in the service has always been friendly and quick as well. This place can get pretty busy on the weekends around dinner time, so there might be a short wait. I recently ordered one of the fish dishes as I was craving it for sometime, however I wasn’t as impressed as I have been with everything else on the menu. It was pretty bland and overly fried making it difficult to eat. I really enjoy the chips and salsa with the side of pickled cabbage that they bring out. The atmosphere of this place is pretty great also, it really ties the whole Mexican restaurant thing together. Overall, I highly recommend this place for some good authentic Mexican dishes.\n",

Dishes were big enough for leftovers, especially since we wanted lo leave room for dessert. The ice-cream was huge, enough for 2 people. We were seated in the side room where we could only hear the ambiance from the main room (mariachi) and the atmosphere didn't transfer. A couple of TVs on the walls will help you stay up to date on sports.\n",

I was gnawing on ribs with sauce up to my elbows when the waiter appeared with a stack of napkins, without my having to ask. And there were more examples of them actively anticipating our needs during the meal, attentively and politely. A warm, welcoming place that has really become my favorite Mexican restaurant.\n",

I tried the taco combo with 2 mahi and 1 Baja. I liked the Baja more and had taken the side of veggies. My wife got the steak fajita. I really loved it and recommend this for sure. The steak was perfectly medium rare and tasted well. One of my friends got the rio classic chile rellenos which was also very good. We also got the chicken enchiladas which was great as well. Overall a great place\n",

My child said  the queso tasted like melted sandwich cheese ☺️ and he was absolutely right about that . Sopapillas were the best thing we enjoyed and the water was delightful .\n",

I ordered a chicken tortilla soup and mini mahi mahi taco , as well as salad with greens, tomatoes and avocado . The soup wasn’t very good and the chicken was too rubbery and I left it on the bottom of the plate . I did like the fish taco and the salad . My Server  was very good !\n",

The Carne asada is amazing. Another must try is the pescado fritz! It's a whole fried snapper in a red sauce. Get the sauce on the side to dip in, it's very spicy.\n",

            "Review: I eat here quite often. 90% of the time I get my food delivered through uber eats and its always fast and delicious! Tonight I got the vegetable fajitas, chorizo nachos, a crispy chile rellano and a taco salad. First the fajitas. They were on par with some of the best fajitas I've ever had!! A pile of onions, peppers, mushrooms, zucchini and broccoli that is well seasoned and cooked to a perfect tenderness. The broccoli still had a nice bite to it, not to hard, not too soft. It was accompanied by a side of well seasoned black beans and rice. The rice by itself is a touch bland but when mixed with the beans, its fantastic! The chorizo nachos are a big portion of homemade chips with typical nacho toppings. Mean, beans, cheese, guac and sour cream topped with fresh tomatoes. Id suggest adding lettuce to step it up even more! The ratio of toppings to chips was nice as well. No chip went un-topped lol. The crispy rellano was indeed not crispy. Tasted great and attribute the soggyness to being packed in a container hot and steamed in delivery. The taco salad is basic. The ground beef is a little bland, could use some salt, but when topped with the house salsa (WHICH IS HOT!) It was very nice. The deliver the taco shell bowl separately from the salad mix which most places don't and it's key to receiving a crispy shell instead of a flimsy soggy bowl! Thank you for that.  This place is consistently very good. I can't speak on anything in restaurant such as service or cleanliness, but the food is a sold 8.72/10 and would recommend giving it a try!\n",

I wish they made the breakfast burritos to order instead of only using one meat every day, since bacon gives me a migraine. But that's presumably a rare problem.  I got the Huevos Rancheros instead and it was just so gosh darn good. The fried potatoes, the green chili , the beans, all amazing.

We ordered the same thing we always do, 2 burritos each. I got the bill and was completely shocked. With 20% tip it was $44.00. They charge you as much to smother it as the burrito cost and they charge per burrito. I pointed this out to the waitress and she said that's the way the computer does it.

I am aware that .50 is not a lot of money, but when this is being charged to everyone that orders a Michelada, that's quite a bit of money.  I have attached photos where you can see that the \"Michelada I ordered in the drink menu is $8. As you can see \"clamato\" is part of the ingredients for this drink. I have also included my receipt, where you can see that they are charging me an additional .50 for the clamato when the clamato is included in the Michelada.  Last time I went there, we ordered about 4 Micheladas total, so that's $2.00 they over charged for that visit, and again last night for the drink I ordered.  No where on that menu does it state that Clamato is an extra charge.  I just thought people should know that this restaurant is over charging you for this and who knows what else.  So pay attention to your receipt before you pay.\n",

The food was definitely the highlight of my experience. However, I must admit that the customer service was a bit disappointing. The young lady who assisted me was quite rude. As a first-time visitor, I was a bit confused about the menu and when I mentioned it was my first time, her response was rather snarky, saying \"well, that makes a lot of sense.\" She didn't seem interested in helping me understand their food options. Despite the subpar service, I would still consider going back for the amazing food, but I hope the service improves in the future.\n",

You can tell it’s very Americanized and of course smothered is a thing. I’m not from Colorado and not a fan. Salsa is another great tell and their salsa is pretty good. All in a pretty well priced, so that’s why I gave it a 4.\n",

Always clean but not really restaurant style. There are seats, but it feels more like a place to sit and wait for Togo food, but you are more than welcome to eat in. Tonight I ordered chicken nachos and veggies fajitas. The nachos come with a generous portion of chicken on a nice bed of chips. It comes with beans, Pico, sour cream and guacamole and some shredded cheese. I would order with extra cheese if I were you! The fajitas are delicious! Very flavorful and the vegetables were cooked delightfully. Not to soft not to hard. Very well seasoned! The rice is usually bland but the beans are good. It's a decent portion. I've had bigger at some places and smaller at others. Their beans are good. By default it comes with one flour tortilla. Idk if they offer corn tortillas instead I have never tried. Everything I have had here has always been good! 9/10 definitely recommended\n",

Service at this place is my favorite.  Always attentive and helpful.  I had the Chile Colorado.  It had good flavor and hit the spot with the beans and rice with corn tortillas.  Wife and son had fajitas… steak and chicken.   They were fantastic, flavorful and finished them all.  Little one had the chicken tenders and fries and loved them.  She said the ranch is bangin!!!  Also had the divorcidas enchiladas.  They were all three delicious.\n",

            "Review: I was very impressed with this restaurant. After having a bad experience at the 3 Margaritas in Westminster we hadn't tried it for several months. This location is huge, and very well put together. It looks well suited to host an event with plenty of seating and an open space for dancing. We were seated immediately and had the choice of the outdoor patio or booth seating inside. We met my grandmother there and they had already brought chips and 2 different salsas to the table. Our waitress was polite and the food came out quickly and was delicious. The portions were big and piping hot. The manager, possibly the owner also came by about mid-way through our meal to make sure we were happy with our food and service. We will return to this location. I'm happy that this restaurant changed my mind about 3 Margaritas as a whole. My one bad experience (at another location) will only keep me away from that particular place.\n",

It was not like any other I had before from other restaurants that use the consome. It was veggie caldo that they put steak in. It was bland and not tasty. I had to add flavor at home The bread was Texas toast not the torta bread like at other places. The only reason it looks red in the picture is because I added hot sauce For the price it was very disappointing. To be honest Del taco has better.\n",

            "Review: Update: I want to believe they were having an off day, however service was taking extremely long, products were not cooked well; overcooked or simply not as fresh as should be. The octopus on a molcajete del Mar was frozen dry. Not even the texture was there much less the flavor. While a molcajete del Mar seems appealing Molcajetes main appeal is for hot food, I expected something special but it was lacking seasoning,flavor and most of all freshness on octopus; it's suppose to have oysters according to the menu but there were none. Their meats molcajete is good but this seemed more like an overpriced coktel or campechana.  The shrimp rellenos were cooked dry, maybe premade and cooked once again, the rice was hard maybe from dryness ,not completely cooked or reheated too many times. They were struggling as far as service with almost full house, but service and teamwork seems flawed.  I mention these things so you can improve and put forth the effort to provide better experience for customers. I rarely go on weekend and had only been during week  for brunch and they seemed to handle the crowd well earlier in the day on Saturday.  Not sure what's going on but sure hope they're able to iron the details and be able to handle the crowds much better.  Old review: This place is great value, delicious, their service has always been good and gotten better. While I've tried various items from carne asada tacos, to Costello, to fajitas lately at least the last 2 times I had their tacos de barbacoa.  I was about to order a molcajete which seem to be new items on the menu however I recalled the tacos were to die for and wanted to confirm if they're spectacular or they had a fluke.  The tacos ended tasting better than I recall. They are so soft and juicy without drowning and sogging the tortilla to point it breaks. The only weakness is the tortilla however since they heat them up properly its a split second I get a whiff of scent they give off. If not heated properly I could not eat type of tortillas. The calamari was pretty good but not as tasty as previous time. This may have been prebatterred or store bought but still delicious.  The barbacoa dish you can get 3 tacos beans and rice or 4 tacos and no beans no rice. Since I had the calamari I opted for the 4 tacos.  Those tacos were AMAZING!\n",

            "Review: It was the first time visiting this establishment. I want to start with the positive: the dining room is decorated well and inviting. After that, it goes downhill. The server had no personality and did not seem to care about our experience. We ordered the dip sampler and both of us ordered the ground beef stuffed sopapilla. The sampler was mediocre; you could tell the guacamole was not made in restaurant. The so-called stuffed sopapillas were deep fried flour tortillas with meat inside. The green chile was also not very good; did not taste like it was made in the restaurant. To make it worse, the prices were outrageous for the kind of food we got. At this point, I don't think I would go there again\n",

Tonight we decided to give it a shot.... mistake... we walked in, were greeted and shown to our table. We sat there waiting for over twenty minutes to get service. A server walked by so I asked if we could grab some drinks. She just walked by and held a stop ✋️ hand signal in our face! When she walked back by she completely ignored us! Completely uncalled for, and rude. So we just got up and walked out! We decided to go to El Mirador for quality Mexican food and true service! We won't be back to Ana's!\n",

            "Review: This is one of my hubby's go to places for a quick burrito as he really likes their spicy salsa. I think they're ok and will go occasionally. We decided to grab some food for a quick dinner, he got his usual burrito and I ordered the Fajitas (chicken). His burrito was done quickly but it appears they forgot my fajitas so finally after waiting and having several customers who ordered after us get their food, we asked about it. The gentleman my husband spoke to was not friendly to either of us and seemed put off that we asked. We finally got our food and I thanked him with no response. The fajitas were only passable and definitely not worth the money or the attitude. I probably won't go back because there is another local place where the service has been always friendly and the food is very tasty especially for the price.\n",

The small combo was more food than I could handle in one sitting!  The chile tasted great, though I admit I was hoping the hot would be spicier.\n",
