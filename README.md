# Notebooks
Collection of Google Colab Enterprise / Jupyter Notebooks

## Google Cloud & Datadog Webinar
The following notebooks were highlighted during the February 7th webinar with Google Cloud and Datadog.

- [Grocery Store Receipt Analysis](grocery-receipt-analysis.ipynb)
- [NASA Short Story](nasa-short-stories.ipynb)
- [Market Summary](market-summary.ipynb)
- [Restaurant Reviews](restaurant-reviews.ipynb)
- [Datadog Custom Logs & Metrics](datadog-custom-logs.ipynb)

>**Important** These notebooks were designed in Colab Enterprise which part of Vertex AI. The authentication to many of the Vertex AI models are automatically handled when the notebooks are run from within a Colab Enterprise notebook from within Vertex AI. Running these notebooks from anywhere else won't work.
